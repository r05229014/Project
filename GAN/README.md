# Generative-Adversarial-Network (GAN)
GANs are composed of two components, a generator and a discriminator. The discriminator has the tasl of detemining whether a given image looks natural (ie, is an image from the dataset) or looks like it has been artificially created. The task of generator is to create natiral looking images that are similar to the original data distribution, image that look natural enough to fool the discriminator.
